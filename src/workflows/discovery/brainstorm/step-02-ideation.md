# Step 2: Ideation

## Context
You have set up the brainstorm session. Now generate ideas using the selected technique.

## Instructions

### SCAMPER Technique

For each dimension, generate ideas:
- **Substitute:** What can be replaced?
- **Combine:** What can be merged?
- **Adapt:** What can be adapted from elsewhere?
- **Modify:** What can be changed in form/size?
- **Put to other use:** New applications?
- **Eliminate:** What can be removed?
- **Reverse:** What can be reversed/rearranged?

### Mind Mapping Technique

Start with central concept and branch out:
1. Write core problem in center
2. Create main branches for key themes
3. Sub-branches for specific ideas
4. Connect related concepts

### Six Thinking Hats

Explore from different perspectives:
- **White:** Facts and data needed
- **Red:** Feelings and intuition
- **Black:** Risks and concerns
- **Yellow:** Benefits and optimism
- **Green:** Creative alternatives
- **Blue:** Process and organization

### Crazy 8s (UI/UX)

1. Fold paper into 8 sections
2. 1 minute per sketch
3. Focus on quantity
4. Don't judge while creating

## Ideation Rules

1. **Defer judgment** - No criticism during ideation
2. **Go for quantity** - More ideas = better outcomes
3. **Build on ideas** - "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."
4. **Stay focused** - Keep topic in mind
5. **One idea per entry** - Easy to evaluate later
