# Step 2: Personas

## Context
Define user personas to understand who we're building for.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify User Segments

Based on product brief, identify distinct user types:
- Primary users (core audience)
- Secondary users (occasional/edge cases)
- Admin/power users (if applicable)

### 2. Create Persona Cards

For each persona, define:

**Persona Template:**
```markdown
### [Persona Name]

**Role:** [job title/role]
**Demographics:** [age range, tech savvy, location]
**Goals:**
- [goal 1]
- [goal 2]

**Pain Points:**
- [pain 1]
- [pain 2]

**Behaviors:**
- [behavior 1]
- [behavior 2]

**Quote:** "[representative quote]"
```

### 3. Map User Journeys

For primary personas, outline key journeys:
- Current state (how they solve problem now)
- Future state (how they'll use our solution)

### 4. Prioritize

Rank personas by importance to MVP.
