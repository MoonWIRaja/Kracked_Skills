# Step 6: MVP Scope

## Context
Define the Minimum Viable Product scope - the smallest deliverable that provides value.

## Instructions

### 1. Define MVP Criteria

What makes this viable?
- Minimum features for user value
- Minimum for market validation
- Minimum for learning

### 2. Select MVP Features

From "Must Have" features:
- Identify core user journey
- Select features that complete that journey
- Remove nice-to-haves

### 3. Define MVP Timeline

Based on complexity:
- Estimate effort for each epic
- Set target release date
- Identify milestones

### 4. List MVP Exclusions

What is explicitly OUT of MVP:
- Features deferred to v1.1
- Features for later phases
- Technical debt acceptable

### 5. Success Criteria

What defines MVP success:
- User acquisition targets
- Engagement metrics
- Technical benchmarks
